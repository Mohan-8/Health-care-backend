# Healthcare Backend API

A backend system for a healthcare application built with Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. This API supports user registration, login with JWT authentication, and management of patients, doctors, and their mappings.

---

## Features

- User authentication with JWT (register and login)
- Patient management (CRUD operations)
- Doctor management (CRUD operations)
- Assign doctors to patients and manage mappings
- Secure endpoints with authentication middleware
- Database interaction with Sequelize ORM
- Environment variables management using dotenv
- Error handling and validation

---

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize ORM
- JWT (JSON Web Token)
- dotenv

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (v14+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- Postman or any API client for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohan-8/Health-care-backend.git
cd healthcare-backend
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

Replace `username`, `password`, `your_database_name`, and `your_jwt_secret_key` accordingly.

4. Run database migrations (using Sequelize CLI)

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:create
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

5. Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

Server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

## Testing

Use Postman or any API client to test the endpoints. Make sure to include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for all authenticated routes:

```

Authorization: Bearer \<your\_jwt\_token>

```

You can also import and test the full API collection directly from Postman here:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## Notes

- Passwords are hashed before storing.
- JWT tokens expire after a set duration (configurable).
- Sequelize handles SQL injection prevention and data sanitization.
- Make sure to configure your `.env` file properly.
